# Git Terminal Basic Commands
This is an amazing repository
So, follow the all instructions completly which is given below

- [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- Ckeck all ckeckbox and click on Next...
- After installing git in your system. Follow these seteps.

**Step 1:**  Create a Folder anywhere in your PC. 

**Step 2:**  Open that Folder and right click in it.

**Step 3:**  You will get an option ```Git Bash here```. Click on it. You will see a commandline prompt.

Now follow the below commands:

```
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email "Your_email@Example.com"
$ git status
```
The above command will show you the status of your repository like 
```
Output:
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
```
It means your directory is not a git repository.

To make a directory as a git repository run ```git init``` command.
```
Output:
Initialized empty Git repository in D:/Git BAsic/.git/
```
After this run ```git ststus``` commnad.
```
Output:
On branch master

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```
It means either your directory is empty or you have already commited the untracket or staged file/folder.

#### Assuming that you have created some file and folder related to your project and now you want to push it in a repository.
Run ``` git status ``` again. You will get:
```
Output:
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
         <file>
         <file>
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

<file> will be in red color i.e it's untracked or modified
  
  
Below command will stage all the files and  Folder
```
$ git add .
# Only the files available in present working directory and sub directory will staged.
or
$ git add -A
or
$ git add --all

$ git add *
# All files will staged except deleted file.
```

Now check the status ```git status``` The new file: <file> will be shown in green color i.e the files are staged.
  
```
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   <file>
        new file:   <file>
```
  
Now Commit the files
```
$ git commit -m "Initial Commit"
```
You can use any appropriate message at the place of "Initial Commit" while commiting. This message will give you the knowledge about the changes in your projects like "Bug fix", "Structure Modified" etc. 

## Create a New Repository
Login to GitHub and click on the ``` + ``` on the top right of browser. select New Repository.

![New Repository](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/repo-create.png)

Enter Repositroy Name

![Repo Name](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/create-repository-owner.png)

Select Public or Private as per your requirement. 

If you wanna initialize this repository with a README then click on checkbox else skip it and click on ``` Create Repository ```
Assume that your repository name is **planets** and username is **mkuzak**

![Repository](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/fig/github-create-repo-03.png)

Congo! you have successfully created a new repository named planets.

# Make a connection between local repository to GitHub repository 
Use below command with your own username.
```
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/usename/planets.git
```

Before pushing the repository you need to add a ```SSH key``` to your account.

# Add SSH key to your account
### You don't have need to add the SSH key again and again if you are using same email and same system. Just add it once for authentication.

Paste the text below, substituting in your GitHub Enterprise email address.
```
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter. This accepts the default file location.
```
Enter a file in which to save the key (/c/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa):[Press enter]
Enter a file in which to save the key (/home/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]> 
Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]
```
![New SSH Key](https://github-images.s3.amazonaws.com/enterprise/2.15/assets/images/help/settings/userbar-account-settings.png)

![Select SSH and GPG key](https://github-images.s3.amazonaws.com/enterprise/2.15/assets/images/help/settings/settings-sidebar-ssh-keys.png)

![Add SSH key](https://github-images.s3.amazonaws.com/enterprise/2.15/assets/images/help/settings/ssh-add-ssh-key.png)

In the "Title" field, add a descriptive label for the new key. For example, if you're using a presonal computer, you might call this key "My PC".

Find **Your Public key has been saved in** ```/c/Users/your_username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub```

copy the Publick Key path and use the command below
```
tail /c/Users/your_username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
You will get some text begins with 'ssh-rsa', 'ssh-dss', 'ssh-ed25519', 'ecdsa-sha2-nistp256', 'ecdsa-sha2-nistp384', or 'ecdsa-sha2-nistp521'

Copy it and Paste your key into the "Key" field. Click on Add SSH key.

![Paste Key](https://github-images.s3.amazonaws.com/enterprise/2.15/assets/images/help/settings/ssh-key-paste.png)

or try below command.
```
$ clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# Copies the contents of the id_rsa.pub file to your clipboard
```
If ``` clip ``` isn't working, you can locate the hidden ```.ssh``` folder, open the file in your favorite text editor, and copy it to your clipboard.


Now you are ready to push your repository to GitHub. Once you type the below command and press enter, your repository will pushed on GitHub in a while depending on the size of files.
```
git push origin master
```
If you want to see the log of your repository use ```git log ``` command.

To get the your name used to config the repository, use command ```git config user.name```
To get your email useed to config the repository, use command ```git config user.email```

If you have changed any thing directy in repository you need to pull first and then modify or update the files otherwise it will raise an error.

Pull master repository
```
git pull origin master
```
Pull a branch 
```
$ git fetch origin <other-branch>
```
Then merge it into your current branch (I'll assume that's ```master```), and fix any merge conflicts:
```
$ git merge origin/other-branch
# Fix merge conflicts, if they occur
# Add merge conflict fixes
$ git commit    # And commit the merge!
```

 # Basic Commands for Branching
 To create a new branch and switch to it at the same time, you can run the ```git checkout``` command with the ```-b ``` switch:
 ```
 $ git checkout -b <New_branch_name>
 ```
 This is shorthand for creating new branch and switch to it.
 ```
 $ git branch <New_branch_name>
$ git checkout <Branch_name>
```
Switched to master branch. Remember that whenever you need to switch to any branch commit the changes before switching.
```
$ git checkout master

Output:
Switched to branch 'master'
```
For direct commit
```
git commit -a -m "Commit Message"
```
Delete a branch afer mearging it in master
```
git branch -d <branch_name>
```
Force delete a branch. If a branch is not required any more or the same branch is available then use ```-D``` switch
```
git branch -D <branch_name>
```
# Basic Merging

Suppose you’ve decided that your "new_branch" is complete and ready to be merged into your master branch. In order to do that, you’ll merge your "new_branch" into master. All you have to do is check out the branch you wish to merge into and then run the ```git merge``` command:
```
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
$ git merge <branch_name>
```
# Basic Merge Conflicts

Occasionally, this process doesn’t go smoothly. If you changed the same part of the same file differently in the two branches you’re merging, Git won’t be able to merge them cleanly. If you fixed a issue modified the same part of a file as the other branch, you’ll get a merge conflict that looks something like this:
```
$ git merge <branch_name>
Auto-merging <fiel>
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in <file>
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```
Git hasn’t automatically created a new merge commit. It has paused the process while you resolve the conflict. If you want to see which files are unmerged at any point after a merge conflict, you can run ```git status```:
```
$ git status
On branch master
You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)

    both modified:     <file>

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```
Anything that has merge conflicts and hasn’t been resolved is listed as unmerged. Git adds standard conflict-resolution markers to the files that have conflicts, so you can open them manually and resolve those conflicts. Your file contains a section that looks something like this:
```
<<<<<<< HEAD:<file>
<div id="footer">contact : email.support@github.com</div>
=======
<div id="footer">
 please contact us at support@github.com
</div>
>>>>>>> <branch_name>:<file>
```
This means the version in HEAD (your master branch, because that was what you had checked out when you ran your merge command) is the top part of that block (everything above the =======), while the version in your <branch_name> looks like everything in the bottom part. In order to resolve the conflict, you have to either choose one side or the other or merge the contents yourself. For instance, you might resolve this conflict by replacing the entire block with this:
```
<div id="footer">
please contact us at email.support@github.com
</div>
```
